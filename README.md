Calculator - CS193p assignments 1 to 4
======================================

This is an iPhone/iPad app for a calculator, following assignments 1 to 4 of the Stanford class CS193p.
At this point it's an RPN graphing calculator, universal app. I implemented all extra credits and then some. (cf. [cs193p.stanford.edu](http://cs193p.stanford.edu))
